# AU Connect — Privacy Policy Page

This repository contains the public **Privacy Policy** for the AU Connect application.  
AU Connect uses third-party authentication providers (such as LinkedIn OAuth), and these services require a publicly accessible privacy policy URL for verification and compliance purposes.

## 🌐 Live Privacy Policy

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the policy will be available at:
